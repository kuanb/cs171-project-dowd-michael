D3_Chloro.html is the master HTML file that links all visualizations.

Data: Most data is in the Data folder, I also have a Raw_Data folder that has some earlier versions of data, or data that I am still processing.

Libs: Contains all the libraries I am using. The libraries are bootstrap, topojson, D3, leaflet, simple-statistics (I wrote my own quantile classification code because I didn't like the output of the D3 quantiles for chloropleth breaks), and D3.queue.

* There are many extra files in the folder right now, when the project is finalized I will clean out the repository so only necessary files and folders are present. *

Please see: <http://mdgis.github.io/ >for working version.
